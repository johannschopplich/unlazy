# `lazyLoad`

The `lazyLoad` function takes a CSS selector, a DOM element, a list of DOM elements, or an array of DOM elements to lazy-load. By default, it processes all images with the `loading="lazy"` attribute

## How It Works

1. Detects whether the visitor is a bot or a crawler. This ensures that the full-quality image is loaded and indexed by search engines.
   - The `data-srcset` attribute will be converted to `srcset`.
   - The `data-src` attribute will be converted to `src`.
2. Processes all images with a `loading="lazy"` attribute.
   - Calculates the image's `sizes` attribute if `data-sizes="auto"` is set.
   - Generates a blurry placeholder from a [hash-based placeholder](/placeholders/hash-based) (BlurHash or ThumbHash) string if applicable.
3. If the image has a blurry placeholder and is already in the viewport or the visitor is a crawler, it immediately loads the full-quality image.
4. If the image is not yet in the viewport, an event listener is added to load the full-quality image when it enters the viewport.

## Options

Options can be passed to the function to customize its behavior:

- `hash`: Whether to use a hash for generating a blurry placeholder. Can be a boolean or a string. Default is `true`. If `thumbhash` is provided, it takes precedence over `blurhash`.
- `hashType`: The type of hash to use. Possible values are `blurhash` and `thumbhash`. Default is `blurhash`.
- `placeholderSize`: The size of the longer edge for BlurHash decoding. Default is `32`. Ignored for ThumbHash.
- `updateSizesOnResize`: Whether to update the `sizes` attribute on window resize events using a debounced ResizeObserver. Default is `false`.
- `onImageLoad`: A callback function invoked when an image loads successfully.

## Return Value

The function returns a cleanup function that removes all event listeners and ResizeObservers created by `lazyLoad`. Call this function when images are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks:

```ts
const cleanup = lazyLoad()

// Later, when cleaning up
cleanup()
```
